### About The Project

I don't have the figma file so it is not pixel perfect. I have tried to make similar as same as possible. Also I added registration logic to this challange. The website is responsive only 1440px and 375px screen sizes. I'll be glad if you give me suggestion about mistakes, lackings and best practices and how can I fix them.
